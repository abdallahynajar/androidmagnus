Goal:

- easily display the contacts which you interact with the most as well as your most frequent mode of communication (text, call, email, etc)

- show immediate results with every interaction and display a dynamic contact 'list' that is visually pleasing and fun

- apart from the 'fun' UI the app would have tons of functionality like communication by phone call/sms/email/chat/social app msg(like orkut scrap), comm. history, display contacts based on communication history/frequency etc.

Visuals:

- remove the idea of the traditional contact 'list', and visualize a black background with "random" placed bubbles

- each bubble represents a contact (i.e. will have the contact name under the bubble)

- the size of the bubble depends on how often you communicate with that person

- the larger bubbles will be toward the top of the 'list' and as you scroll/float down the smaller bubbles are displayed (similar to how larger bubbles float higher then smaller bubbles)

- bubbles can have gmail/facebook/<any social network site> picture in them. (Perhaps the bubbles could also act as a feed? Whenever someone adds to their SNS it gets larger? Vibrates?)

Interactions:

- when bubble selected/touched the bubble bursts into other bubbles and your most predominant mode of communication with that person is now the largest bubble

- selecting the communication bubble will cause it to pop and start the communication app
